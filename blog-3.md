## Question: Why are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

## Answer: 
Type Guards are necessary because TypeScript is a statically typed language and it needs to know the type of a variable at compile time. If TypeScript cannot determine the type of a variable, it will throw an error. Type Guards are used to help TypeScript determine the type of a variable at runtime. There are several types of Type Guards in TypeScript, including typeof, instanceof, and user-defined Type Guards.

## Example with code :

```typescript
function isNumber(value: any): value is number {
  return typeof value === 'number';
}

function isString(value: any): value is string {
  return typeof value === 'string';
}

function isObject(value: any): value is object {
  return typeof value === 'object';
}

let x: any = 10;

if (isNumber(x)) {
  console.log('x is a number');
} else if (isString(x)) {
  console.log('x is a string');
} else if (isObject(x)) {
  console.log('x is an object');
} else {
  console.log('x is something else');
}
```

In this example, I have defined three user-defined Type Guards: isNumber, isString, and isObject. These functions check the type of the value passed to them and return a boolean value indicating whether the value is of the specified type. I then use these Type Guards to know the type of the variable x and log the result to the console.

Type Guards are useful in some places where TypeScript cannot infer the type of a variable, such as when working with union types or dynamic data. By using Type Guards, I can provide TypeScript with the information it needs to correctly type-check our code and avoid runtime errors.

Type Guards are an essential feature of TypeScript and are used extensively in real-world applications to ensure type safety and improve code quality.
